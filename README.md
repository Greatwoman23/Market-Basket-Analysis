#  Welcome to Market Basket Analysis.

Welcome to the Market Basket Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase patterns to uncover associations between different items. The primary goal is 
to provide insights that can be valuable for marketing and product placement strategies.


# Task
The main task of this project is to conduct market basket analysis using Python. The analysis involves exploring frequent itemsets, association rules, and visualizing the results.
The Apriori algorithm is employed to discover patterns within transactions, and key metrics such as support, confidence, and lift are used to evaluate the strength of associations.


Description
The project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Exploration: The dataset is preprocessed, and relevant columns are selected for analysis. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the structure of 
the data.

Correlation Heatmap: A correlation heatmap is created to visualize the relationships between different items and customer-related attributes. This helps identify potential 
patterns and correlations in the data.

Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm is applied to identify frequent itemsets in the dataset. Association rules are then generated based on these item sets.

Association Rules Analysis: The generated association rules are analyzed, and key metrics such as confidence and lift are examined.
The top association rules are sorted and displayed to provide actionable insights.

Visualization: The results are visualized using various plots, including bar charts for frequent itemsets and a network plot for association rules.
